## Usage Examples

### Creating Questions with Answer Types

```typescript
// Create a username question
await supaclient.createQuestion(
  "Who is the funniest person in the community?",
  null,
  'username'
);

// Create a general question
await supaclient.createQuestion(
  "What is your favorite color?",
  "https://example.com/colors.jpg",
  'general'
);
```

### Making Suggestions Live

```typescript
// Create and immediately start a question from suggestion
await supaclient.createAndStartQuestion(
  "Who gives the best advice?",
  "https://example.com/advice.gif",
  'username'
);
```

## Database Migration

To apply these changes to your database:

```sql
-- Run this SQL file
\i database/add_question_answer_type.sql
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Answer Expectations**: Users now know whether to provide a username or general answer
2. **Streamlined Admin Workflow**: Suggestions can be made live instantly with customization
3. **Flexible Question Management**: Live questions can be edited including their answer type
4. **Better Organization**: Questions are categorized by expected answer format

## Technical Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing questions default to 'general' answer type
- Mock implementation mirrors real Supabase functionality
- TypeScript types updated for type safety
- Database functions updated to include answer_type in responses

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for:
- Different answer processing logic based on type
- Answer validation based on expected type
- Analytics and reporting by answer type
- UI enhancements specific to answer types
