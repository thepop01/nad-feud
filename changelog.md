## [Previous Updates] - Earlier Development

### Fixed
- **Critical Auth Fix:** Completely overhauled the `onAuthStateChange` listener initialization in `services/supabase.ts`. The application now correctly handles errors that occur when the listener is first created (e.g., due to a corrupted token), preventing the app from hanging on a blank screen. This ensures the app's loading sequence always completes, either to a logged-in or logged-out state.
- Hardened the Supabase `onAuthStateChange` handler to prevent application startup failures. The logic for retrieving the auth subscription is now safer, and the error handling within the auth callback has been improved to prevent unhandled exceptions during sign-out attempts. This resolves both the "blank screen" issue and the "cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'unsubscribe')" error.
- Resolved an initial critical bug causing a blank screen on application load by safely handling the Supabase authentication listener subscription.

### Added

## üìù **Migration & Upgrade Notes**

### **Required Database Migrations:**
If upgrading from a previous version, run these database migration scripts in order:

1. **`database/ensure_alltime_highlights_categories.sql`**
   - Creates `all_time_community_highlights` table if missing
   - Adds category column with proper constraints
   - Sets up indexes and RLS policies

2. **`database/migrate_highlights_to_alltime.sql`** (if needed)
   - Migrates existing community highlights to all-time highlights
   - Assigns default "community" category to highlights without categories
   - Preserves all existing data and metadata

### **Breaking Changes:**
- **Highlight System Separation** - Featured highlights (homepage) and all-time highlights (dedicated page) are now completely separate systems
- **Category Requirement** - All-time highlights now require a category assignment from the 5 available options
- **Admin Panel Changes** - Different admin components for managing different highlight types
- **API Function Changes** - Updated function calls for highlight retrieval (`getAllTimeHighlights()` vs `getAllCommunityHighlights()`)

### **Compatibility Notes:**
- **Database Schema** - New category column added to `all_time_community_highlights` table
- **Component Updates** - Modified admin panel routing and component usage
- **Type Definitions** - Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for category support
- **Authentication** - Extended timeouts and cookie expiry for better user experience

### **Post-Migration Steps:**
1. **Verify Data Migration** - Check that all highlights appear correctly in admin panel
2. **Assign Categories** - Review and update highlight categories as needed through admin interface
3. **Test Authentication** - Verify improved login experience with extended timeouts
4. **Clear Browser Cache** - Recommended for users to see UI improvements
