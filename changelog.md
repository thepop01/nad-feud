## [Previous Updates] - Earlier Development

### Fixed
- **Critical Auth Fix:** Completely overhauled the `onAuthStateChange` listener initialization in `services/supabase.ts`. The application now correctly handles errors that occur when the listener is first created (e.g., due to a corrupted token), preventing the app from hanging on a blank screen. This ensures the app's loading sequence always completes, either to a logged-in or logged-out state.
- Hardened the Supabase `onAuthStateChange` handler to prevent application startup failures. The logic for retrieving the auth subscription is now safer, and the error handling within the auth callback has been improved to prevent unhandled exceptions during sign-out attempts. This resolves both the "blank screen" issue and the "cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'unsubscribe')" error.
- Resolved an initial critical bug causing a blank screen on application load by safely handling the Supabase authentication listener subscription.

## �️ **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues Encountered & Solutions:**

#### **🚨 "Highlights page not loading" Error**
- **Symptoms**: Blank page, infinite loading, or component crashes
- **Root Cause**: Type mismatches between `CommunityHighlight` and `AllTimeCommunityHighlight`
- **Solution**: Update all component references to use `AllTimeCommunityHighlight` type
- **Files Affected**: `CommunityHighlightsPage.tsx`, `CommunityHighlightsCarousel.tsx`

#### **🚨 "Authentication process timed out" Error**
- **Symptoms**: Login fails with timeout message after 5 seconds
- **Root Cause**: Discord API delays during peak usage or slow network
- **Solution**: Extended timeouts from 5s to 15s in authentication handlers
- **Files Affected**: `services/supabase.ts`, `hooks/useAuth.tsx`

#### **🚨 "Featured highlights appearing in all-time highlights" Error**
- **Symptoms**: Same highlights appear in both admin panels
- **Root Cause**: Migration script copied featured highlights to all-time table
- **Solution**: Run SQL cleanup script to enforce data separation
- **Database Fix**: Remove duplicates and enforce table boundaries

#### **🚨 "UNION types uuid and text cannot be matched" SQL Error**
- **Symptoms**: Database query fails with type mismatch error
